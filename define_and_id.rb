# Run each line of code below (either from this file or in IRB individually).
#  Then, in a ruby comment, write 1-2 sentences describing what is happening, using ALL the involved vocabulary terms you've learned in this lesson so far.

# EXAMPLE
# The downcase method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# No arguments are passed; downcase has one clear job which is to lowercase all letters that exist in the String
# The return value is "hello world"
"Hello World".downcase

# YOU DO the rest:
# The string class method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# There are no arguments, And is used to return true if the given string contains the given string.
# the return reads back=> true

"Hello World".include?("Hello")

# This string class method is called on the string object "Hello World"
# This string returns true if string ends with one of the suffixes give.
# This string return value is false.

"Hello World".end_with?("Hello")

#This string class method is called on the string object "Hello World"
#This string returns true if string ends with one of the given suffixes.
#This string return value is true.

"Hello World".end_with?("rld")

# This method returns boolean value.
# It returns true if the number is even.
12.even?

# .next has two meaning and one is a method
# it is used to halt the current block iteration where it is and allow the parent loop to continue
18.next
