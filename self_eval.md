# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel much better than when I started since I have no knowledge of coding. I think its cool using the different methods

- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
Simple methods are easy to understand but the tougher ones will be a doozy.

- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
 Ive read that the '!' will either reverse the condition like if it returned true it would make it false or it will modify the string. Still confused about how to use this?
